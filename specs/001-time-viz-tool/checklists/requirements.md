# Specification Quality Checklist: 一日時間視覺化工具

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-12-23  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Validation Date**: 2025-12-23  
**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for planning phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- 4 well-prioritized user stories (2 P1, 2 P2) with clear acceptance criteria
- 18 comprehensive functional requirements covering all user flows
- 7 measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- 6 documented edge cases
- Clear scope boundaries with explicit exclusions

**Next Steps**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation tasks.
